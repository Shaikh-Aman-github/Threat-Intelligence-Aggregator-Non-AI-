# Threat Intelligence Aggregator (Non-AI)

## Overview

The **Threat Intelligence Aggregator (Non-AI)** is a Python-based cybersecurity toolkit developed as part of the **Unified Mentor Cybersecurity Internship**.

The project collects, validates, normalizes, correlates, and reports **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** from multiple threat intelligence sources without using Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning.

It demonstrates practical **Blue Team** techniques used in Security Operations Centers (SOC), including IOC parsing, threat feed aggregation, correlation analysis, blocklist generation, and reporting.

# Features

## IOC Feed Collection

Supports loading threat intelligence from:

* Local TXT files
* CSV files
* JSON IOC feeds
* STIX Bundle (JSON)
* Remote URL-based threat feeds

Users can:

* Use existing feeds
* Upload one or multiple custom feeds
* Download public OSINT threat feeds

---

## Supported IOC Types

* IPv4 Addresses
* Domains
* URLs
* Email Addresses
* MD5 Hashes
* SHA-256 Hashes

---

## Feed Validation

Before processing, every uploaded feed is validated.

Validation includes:

* Supported file type verification
* Empty file detection
* JSON structure validation
* STIX bundle validation
* CSV column validation
* URL validation
* IOC format validation

---

## IOC Normalization

Every IOC is normalized into a common format.

Each record contains:

* Indicator
* IOC Type
* Source Feed
* Timestamp
* Category
* Severity

---

## IOC Correlation Engine

The correlation engine identifies repeated indicators appearing across multiple feeds.

Severity Levels:

| IOC Count | Severity |
| --------- | -------- |
| 1         | Low      |
| 2–3       | Medium   |
| 4+        | High     |

---

## SQLite Database

All normalized IOCs are stored in a SQLite database.

Database features include:

* Automatic table creation
* IOC persistence
* Database cleanup before processing
* IOC counting

Database File:

```text
database/threatintel.db
```

---

## Blocklist Generation

Automatically generates:

* IP Blocklist
* Domain Blocklist
* URL Blocklist
* Hash Blocklist
* Email Blocklist

Export Formats:

* TXT
* CSV
* JSON

---

## Reporting

Generates:

* Normalized IOC Database (JSON)
* Correlation Report (CSV)
* PDF Threat Intelligence Report
